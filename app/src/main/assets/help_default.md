## How to use Loopy

Loopy is a simple audio player that lets you loop audio files you have on your phone. You can search your media library, but it also comes with a file browser, in case you want to search your device's storage.

### Getting started

If you open the app for the first time, Loopy contains a set of example loops, so you can test the app. To add own files, click the menu icon in the top left corner and choose either *Browse music library* or *Browse phone storage*, depending on where you want to look for audio files. 

### Selecting audio files

Audio files Loopy can play will have a little checkbox to the right. Mark the ones you like and click *Open selecetion* to add them to your player selection (or click *Select all* to mark everything).

### Playing loops

Click on the loop you want to play. It will be highlighted and immediately start to play. You can use the controls at the bottom to pause (Halting playback at the current position in the track) or stop (Complete stop and reset to the beginning) the playback.

### Removing loops from the player

Remove files from the player by clicking the "X" icon in a loop item's top right corner. In the drawer menu you will find the option *Clear current file selection*. Click this to clean up your player window. 

### Settings

If you click on *Change app settings* in the drawer menu you find a number of options to customize Loopy to your needs:

#### Loop switching behaviour

The standard mode *Switch immediately* lets you switch between loops just by clicking on them. If you use *Wait until finished* the player will preselect the loop you want to switch to, but wait until the current one is completely played before starting the next one.

#### Accepted file types

If you want to only pick audio files of a certain type, you can uncheck the unwanted ones here, so the browser won't show them to you. Currently Loopy supports MP3, Wave and Ogg.

### Sample Rate

Chose the sample rate that fits your audio files. Currently you can chose between the three standard values 44.1kHz, 48kHz and 96kHz.

#### Show loop count

If you activate this option, a counter will show you how often the loop currently playing has already been repeated. If you switch to another loop, the counter will be reset.


#### Keep Screen on

This option keeps the screen on while Loopy is being used.

#### Play in Background

Use this option to define whether or not Loopy should keep playing while in background or when the screen turns off.
