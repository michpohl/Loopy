### What's new in Loopy II 1.0

**Thank you for using Loopy II!**

Loopy II brings a lot of changes over Loopy I. Key improvements:

* Now uses low level C++ code to process audio playback. It's faster and helps making sure the looping is really seamless.
* Audio files are now pre-transcoded and stored internally, for better performance ( If you remove an entry from your player, the file is removed from Loopy's storage)
* You can now pick between three different sample rates, to adjust for your audio files' encoding
* Updated and improved design
* Many small bugs got fixed
