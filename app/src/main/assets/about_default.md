Loopy is an audio player dedicated to seamlessly looping audio files
It can basically loop every audio file you have in your media library.

Loopy is **not an audio editor**, so the loops you want to use should already be prepared and edited properly, if you need exact results.
Please keep in mind: Loopy is a hobby project, so please don't expect it to be 100% perfect. If you encounter issues, please let me know!

If you use Loopy's "Wait until finished" you can use Loopy as a very simple live composition tool. It allows you to pre-select what loop to switch to after the current one finishes, so with a prepared set of loops you can put them together on-the-fly.

Loopy is free and open source. It is released under the Apache 2.0 License.
