# Loopy Audio Looper


Loopy is an audio player for Android devices dedicated to seamlessly looping audio files. It can basically loop every audio file you have in your media library.

Find the app in the Google Play Store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.michaelpohl.loopyplayer2 
Or just check out this repository and compile it yourself using Android studio or whichever way you like (code in this repo is usually ahead of the version on the Play store)

**Loopy is not an audio editor!** So the loops you want to use should already be prepared and edited properly, if you need exact results. It's purpose is to provide a solution to those who just want to play audio files in loop, like DJs, artists, musicians, who can use this for easy training sessions, to provide gapless background atmosphere or play neverending beat loops. I am sure it is not the only app capable of this, but it is the one I made :-)

If you use Loopy's "Wait until finished" you can use Loopy as a very simple live composition tool. It allows you to pre-select what loop to switch to after the current one finishes, so with a prepared set of loops you can put them together on-the-fly.

Loopy is written with joy in Kotlin and C++ using [oboe](https://github.com/google/oboe). The min SDK version is 21.
